Introduction
------------
Radio controlled cars come with some big radio remotes for controlling them. Those remotes are not really convenient to carry especially then the car model is 1:28 or so, remote is 3-4 times bigger than actual car. Also, each car has its remote, so if we have several cars we have to have several remotes.
So let’s build our own remote – use Smartphone for controlling the cars. In addition, we can use 1 Smartphone to control all cars. The car will provide some API for making more interesting controlling – like automated driving.
